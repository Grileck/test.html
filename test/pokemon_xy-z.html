  <p><h1>Why is pokemon so interesting?</h1></p> 
  <p><h4>Gamers are wide and varied, and Pokemon brings something more focused on collecting, leveling and balancing abilities given limited slots. When people who have played Final Fantasy talk about it, they go to specific scenes like Celes Opera moment, the battle engine, character development and such.</h4></p>
