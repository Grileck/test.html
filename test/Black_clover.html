        <p><h1>What is black clover?</h1></p>
        <p><h4>Black Clover (Japanese: ブラッククローバー, Hepburn: Burakku Kurōbā) is a Japanese manga series written and illustrated by Yūki Tabata. The story centers around Asta, a young boy born without any magic power. This is unknown to the world he lives in because seemingly everyone has some sort of magic power. With his fellow mages from the Black Bulls, Asta plans to become the next Wizard King. It has been serialized in Shueisha's Weekly Shōnen Jump magazine since February 2015, with its chapters collected in 28 tankōbon volumes as of April 2021.

            The manga was first adapted into an original video animation produced by Xebec Zwei, released in 2017. An anime television series adaptation produced by Pierrot aired in Japan on TV Tokyo from October 2017 to March 2021. An anime film has been announced.
            
            In North America, the manga is licensed for English release by Viz Media, while the anime series is licensed by Crunchyroll and Funimation.</h4></p>
